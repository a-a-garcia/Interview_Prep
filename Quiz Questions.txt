#1 Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`.

1st BLIND ANSWER : 

The <script> tag is an HTML tag that denotes the presence of a javascript file, to be loaded when the DOM is loaded. Plain <script> means the JS will execute whenever it 
is encountered in the head, which usually means immediately. <script async> means the JS will execute asynchronously. (?) and <script defer> means the JS will load after everything else in the page has loaded.

CORRECT ANSWER:

`<script>` tags are used to include JavaScript on a web page. The `async` and `defer` attributes are used to change how/when the loading and execution of the script happens.

Plain `<script>` - when encountered, HTML parsing is blocked
