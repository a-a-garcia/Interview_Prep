**#15: Can you offer a use case for arrow function syntax?**

**Answer**:
It's a more concise way to write functions, and also has some differences in how `this` behaves compared to traditional function expressions.


__Advantages__:
* Conciseness: More concise, making code shorter/easier to read

* `this` Behavior: Arrow functions don't have their own `this`. Instead, they **inherit `this` from the parent scope, at the time that they are defined**. This is very useful in scenarios where you are **dealing with callbacks and want to retain the context of `this`.**

* Implicit return: If the function body consists of a single expression, arrow functions allow you to omit the `return` keyword and curly braces (again, conciseness)

**When to use?**

* When you need a quick, one-line function.

* In callback functions, where you want to preserve the lexical scope of `this`.

* When working with higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.

**When NOT to use?**

* Methods in objects: Again, arrow functions don't have their own `this` context, which can lead to unexpected behavior in object methods.

* As constructors: Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors. You'll get an error if you try to use them with the `new` keyword.

* When you need to use function hoisting: Arrow functions are not hoisted, unlike traditional function declarations.

Arrow functions are a powerful addition to JavaScript, simplifying function syntax and addressing some common pitfalls associated with the this keyword in traditional functions. They are especially useful in modern JavaScript development patterns.
