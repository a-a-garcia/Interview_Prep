**Have you played around with CSS Flexbox or Grid specs?**

**Answer:**

Yes, Flexbox is mainly meant for 1-dimensional layouts, whild Grid is meant for 2 dimensional layouts.

Flexbox solves many problems in CSS, such as:
    * Vertical centering of elements within a container
    * Sticky footer

Famous CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are based on flexbox. It's still the tested and proven way to create layouts.

Grid is a more intuitive appraoch for creating grid-based layouts. However, many layout problems can be solved with Flex, so it can often be a matter of developer preference.
